  KATANA Framework

  Well, I've started a framework that seeks to unite general tools
  audits, which are tools for both audit and audit web
  Network and others. if you want to support the project or want to be part of the adding
  modules or scripts, you can do it and you put in conctato with me, to add
  the official version.
 
  This project is Open Source (s python), so You can see and learn a little.
  but this just beginning the much expected, so if you want to support the cause
  and do something for the community this is the opportunity.

  if you have tools made for you and you want you can also contact agragarlas
  to evaluate them and then add them to their respective credits

  Thanks.
